# Training multiple labels
# Here's a small sample of a dataset created to train a new entity type WEBSITE. The original dataset contains a few
# thousand sentences. In this exercise, you'll be doing the labeling by hand. In real life, you probably want to
# automate this and use an annotation tool â€“ for example, Brat, a popular open-source solution, or Prodigy, our own
# annotation tool that integrates with spaCy.

TRAINING_DATA = [
    ("Reddit partners with Patreon to help creators build communities",
     {'entities': [(0, 6, 'WEBSITE'), (21, 28, 'WEBSITE')]}),

    ("PewDiePie smashes YouTube record",
     {'entities': [(18, 25, 'WEBSITE')]}),

    ("Reddit founder Alexis Ohanian gave away two Metallica tickets to fans",
     {'entities': [(0, 6, 'WEBSITE')]}),
    # And so on...
]

# Update the training data to include annotations for the PERSON entities "PewDiePie" and "Alexis Ohanian".
