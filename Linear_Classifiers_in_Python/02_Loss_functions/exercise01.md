### Minimizing a loss function

In this exercise you'll implement linear regression "from scratch" using `scipy.optimize.minimize`.

We'll train a model on the Boston housing price data set, which is already loaded into the variables `X` and `y`. For simplicity, we won't include an intercept in our regression model.
