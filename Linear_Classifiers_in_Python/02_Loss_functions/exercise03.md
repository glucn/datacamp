### Implementing logistic regression

This is very similar to the earlier exercise where you implemented linear regression "from scratch" using `scipy.optimize.minimize`. However, this time we'll minimize the logistic loss and compare with scikit-learn's `LogisticRegression` (we've set `C` to a large value to disable regularization; more on this in Chapter 3!).

The `log_loss()` function from the previous exercise is already defined in your environment, and the `sklearn` breast cancer prediction dataset (first 10 features, standardized) is loaded into the variables `X` and `y`.
