### Fitting multi-class logistic regression

In this exercise, you'll fit the two types of multi-class logistic regression, one-vs-rest and softmax/multinomial, on the handwritten digits data set and compare the results. The handwritten digits dataset is already loaded and split into `X_train`, `y_train`, `X_test`, and `y_test`.
