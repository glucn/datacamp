### Logistic regression and feature selection

In this exercise we'll perform feature selection on the movie review sentiment data set using L1 regularization. The features and targets are already loaded for you in `X_train` and `y_train`.

We'll search for the best value of `C` using scikit-learn's `GridSearchCV()`, which was covered in the prerequisite course.
