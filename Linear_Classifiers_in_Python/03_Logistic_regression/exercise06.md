### Visualizing multi-class logistic regression

In this exercise we'll continue with the two types of multi-class logistic regression, but on a toy 2D data set specifically designed to break the one-vs-rest scheme.

The data set is loaded into `X_train` and `y_train`. The two logistic regression objects,`lr_mn` and `lr_ovr`, are already instantiated (with `C=100`), fit, and plotted.

Notice that `lr_ovr` never predicts the dark blue class... yikes! Let's explore why this happens by plotting one of the binary classifiers that it's using behind the scenes.
