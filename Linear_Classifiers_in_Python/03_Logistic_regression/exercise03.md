### Identifying the most positive and negative words

In this exercise we'll try to interpret the coefficients of a logistic regression fit on the movie review sentiment dataset. The model object is already instantiated and fit for you in the variable `lr`.

In addition, the words corresponding to the different features are loaded into the variable `vocab`. For example, since `vocab[100]` is "think", that means feature 100 corresponds to the number of times the word "think" appeared in that movie review.
