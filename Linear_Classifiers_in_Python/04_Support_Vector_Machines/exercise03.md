### Jointly tuning gamma and C with GridSearchCV

In the previous exercise the best value of `gamma` was 0.001 using the default value of `C`, which is 1. In this exercise you'll search for the best combination of `C` and `gamma` using `GridSearchCV`.

As in the previous exercise, the 2-vs-not-2 digits dataset is already loaded, but this time it's split into the variables `X_train`, `y_train`, `X_test`, and `y_test`. Even though cross-validation already splits the training set into parts, it's often a good idea to hold out a separate test set to make sure the cross-validation results are sensible.
