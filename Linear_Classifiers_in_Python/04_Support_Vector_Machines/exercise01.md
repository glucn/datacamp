### Effect of removing examples

Support vectors are defined as training examples that influence the decision boundary. In this exercise, you'll observe this behavior by removing non support vectors from the training set.

The wine quality dataset is already loaded into `X` and `y` (first two features only). (Note: we specify `lims` in `plot_classifier()` so that the two plots are forced to use the same axis limits and can be compared directly.)
