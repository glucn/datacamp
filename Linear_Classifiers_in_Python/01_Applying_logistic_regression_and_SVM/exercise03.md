### Sentiment analysis for movie reviews

In this exercise you'll explore the probabilities outputted by logistic regression on a subset of the [Large Movie Review Dataset](http://ai.stanford.edu/~amaas/data/sentiment/).

The variables `X` and `y` are already loaded into the environment. `X` contains features based on the number of times words appear in the movie reviews, and `y` contains labels for whether the review sentiment is positive (+1) or negative (-1).
