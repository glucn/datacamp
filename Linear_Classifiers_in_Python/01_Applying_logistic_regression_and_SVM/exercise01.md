### KNN classification

In this exercise you'll explore a subset of the [Large Movie Review Dataset](http://ai.stanford.edu/~amaas/data/sentiment/). The variables `X_train`, `X_test`, `y_train`, and `y_test` are already loaded into the environment. The `X` variables contain features based on the words in the movie reviews, and the`y`variables contain labels for whether the review sentiment is positive (+1) or negative (-1).
