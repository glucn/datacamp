# Efficient phrase matching
# Sometimes it's more efficient to match exact strings instead of writing patterns describing the individual tokens.
# This is especially true for finite categories of things – like all countries of the world.
#
# We already have a list of countries, so let's use this as the basis of our information extraction script. A list of
# string names is available as the variable COUNTRIES. The nlp object and a test doc have already been created and
# the doc.text has been printed to the shell.

from spacy.lang.en import English

from preload import COUNTRIES

nlp = English()
doc = nlp('Czech Republic may help Slovakia protect its airspace')

# Import the PhraseMatcher and initialize it
from spacy.matcher import PhraseMatcher
matcher = PhraseMatcher(nlp.vocab)

# Create pattern Doc objects and add them to the matcher
# This is the faster version of: [nlp(country) for country in COUNTRIES]
patterns = list(nlp.pipe(COUNTRIES))
matcher.add('COUNTRY', None, *patterns)

# Call the matcher on the test document and print the result
matches = matcher(doc)
print([doc[start:end] for match_id, start, end in matches])
