# Documents, spans and tokens
# When you call nlp on a string, spaCy first tokenizes the text and creates a document object. In this exercise,
# you'll learn more about the Doc, as well as its views Token and Span.

# Import the English language class and create the nlp object
from spacy.lang.en import English
nlp = English()

# Process the text
doc = nlp("I like tree kangaroos and narwhals.")

# Select the first token
first_token = doc[0]

# Print the first token's text
print(first_token.text)

# A slice of the Doc for "tree kangaroos"
tree_kangaroos = doc[2:4]
print(tree_kangaroos.text)

# A slice of the Doc for "tree kangaroos and narwhals" (without the ".")
tree_kangaroos_and_narwhals = doc[2:6]
print(tree_kangaroos_and_narwhals.text)
