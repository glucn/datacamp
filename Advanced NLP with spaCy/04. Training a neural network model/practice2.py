# Setting up the pipeline
# In this exercise, you'll prepare a spaCy pipeline to train the entity recognizer to recognize 'GADGET' entities in
# a text – for example, "iPhone X".
#
# spacy has already been imported for you.

import spacy

# Create a blank 'en' model
nlp = spacy.blank('en')

# Create a new entity recognizer and add it to the pipeline
ner = nlp.create_pipe('ner')
nlp.add_pipe(ner)

# Add the label 'GADGET' to the entity recognizer
ner.add_label('GADGET')
