# Fit & predict for regression
# Now, you will fit a linear regression and predict life expectancy using just one feature. You saw Andy do this
# earlier using the 'RM' feature of the Boston housing dataset. In this exercise, you will use the 'fertility' feature
# of the Gapminder dataset. Since the goal is to predict life expectancy, the target variable here is 'life'. The
# array for the target variable has been pre-loaded as y and the array for 'fertility' has been pre-loaded as
# X_fertility.
#
# A scatter plot with 'fertility' on the x-axis and 'life' on the y-axis has been generated. As you can see, there is
# a strongly negative correlation, so a linear regression should be able to capture this trend. Your job is to fit a
# linear regression and then predict the life expectancy, overlaying these predicted values on the plot to generate a
# regression line. You will also compute and print the  score using sckit-learn's .score() method.

import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

from preload import X_fertility, y

plt.scatter(X_fertility, y)
plt.xlabel('Fertility')
plt.ylabel('Life Expectancy')


# Import LinearRegression
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression

# Create the regressor: reg
reg = LinearRegression()

# Create the prediction space
prediction_space = np.linspace(min(X_fertility), max(X_fertility)).reshape(-1, 1)

# Fit the model to the data
reg.fit(X_fertility, y)

# Compute predictions over the prediction space: y_pred
y_pred = reg.predict(prediction_space)

# Print R^2
print(reg.score(X_fertility, y))

# Plot regression line
plt.plot(prediction_space, y_pred, color='black', linewidth=3)
plt.show()
