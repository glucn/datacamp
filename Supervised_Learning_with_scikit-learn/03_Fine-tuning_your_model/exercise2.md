### Building a logistic regression model

Time to build your first logistic regression model! As Hugo showed in the video, scikit-learn makes it very easy to try different models, since the Train-Test-Split/Instantiate/Fit/Predict paradigm applies to all classifiers and regressors - which are known in scikit-learn as 'estimators'. You'll see this now for yourself as you train a logistic regression model on exactly the same data as in the previous exercise. Will it outperform k-NN? There's only one way to find out!

The feature and target variable arrays `X` and `y` have been pre-loaded, and `train_test_split` has been imported for you from `sklearn.model_selection`.
