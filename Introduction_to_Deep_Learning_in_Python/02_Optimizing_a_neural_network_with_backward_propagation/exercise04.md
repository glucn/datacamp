### Improving model weights

Hurray! You've just calculated the slopes you need. Now it's time to use those slopes to improve your model. If you add the slopes to your weights, you will move in the right direction. However, it's possible to move too far in that direction. So you will want to take a small step in that direction first, using a lower learning rate, and verify that the model is improving.

The weights have been pre-loaded as `weights`, the actual value of the target as `target`, and the input data as `input_data`. The predictions from the initial weights are stored as `preds`.
