### Applying the network to many observations/rows of data

You'll now define a function called `predict_with_network()` which will generate predictions for multiple data observations, which are pre-loaded as `input_data`. As before, `weights` are also pre-loaded. In addition, the `relu()` function you defined in the previous exercise has been pre-loaded.
