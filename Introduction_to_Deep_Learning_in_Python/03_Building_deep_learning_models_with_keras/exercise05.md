### Making predictions

The trained network from your previous coding exercise is now stored as `model`. New data to make predictions is stored in a NumPy array as `pred_data`. Use `model` to make predictions on your new data.

In this exercise, your predictions will be probabilities, which is the most common way for data scientists to communicate their predictions to colleagues.
