### Adding layers to a network

You've seen how to experiment with wider networks. In this exercise, you'll try a deeper network (more hidden layers).

Once again, you have a baseline model called `model_1` as a starting point. It has 1 hidden layer, with `50` units. You can see a summary of that model's structure printed out. You will create a similar network with 3 hidden layers (still keeping 50 units in each layer).

This will again take a moment to fit both models, so you'll need to wait a few seconds to see the results after you run your code.
