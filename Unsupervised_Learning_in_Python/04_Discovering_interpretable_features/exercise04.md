### Explore the LED digits dataset

In the following exercises, you'll use NMF to decompose grayscale images into their commonly occurring patterns. Firstly, explore the image dataset and see how it is encoded as an array. You are given 100 images as a 2D array `samples`, where each row represents a single 13x8 image. The images in your dataset are pictures of a LED digital display.
