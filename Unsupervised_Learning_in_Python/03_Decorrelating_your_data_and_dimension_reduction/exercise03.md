### The first principal component

The first principal component of the data is the direction in which the data varies the most. In this exercise, your job is to use PCA to find the first principal component of the length and width measurements of the grain samples, and represent it as an arrow on the scatter plot.

The array `grains` gives the length and width of the grain samples. PyPlot (`plt`) and `PCA` have already been imported for you.
