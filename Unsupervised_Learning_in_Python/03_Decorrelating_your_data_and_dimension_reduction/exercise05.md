### Dimension reduction of the fish measurements

In a previous exercise, you saw that `2` was a reasonable choice for the "intrinsic dimension" of the fish measurements. Now use PCA for dimensionality reduction of the fish measurements, retaining only the 2 most important components.

The fish measurements have already been scaled for you, and are available as `scaled_samples`.
