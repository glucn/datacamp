### A tf-idf word-frequency array

In this exercise, you'll create a tf-idf word frequency array for a toy collection of documents. For this, use the `TfidfVectorizer` from sklearn. It transforms a list of documents into a word frequency array, which it outputs as a csr_matrix. It has `fit()` and `transform()` methods like other sklearn objects.

You are given a list `documents` of toy documents about pets. Its contents have been printed in the IPython Shell.
