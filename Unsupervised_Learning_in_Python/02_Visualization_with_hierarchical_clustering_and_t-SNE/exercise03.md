### Different linkage, different hierarchical clustering!

In the video, you saw a hierarchical clustering of the voting countries at the Eurovision song contest using `'complete'` linkage. Now, perform a hierarchical clustering of the voting countries with `'single'` linkage, and compare the resulting dendrogram with the one in the video. Different linkage, different hierarchical clustering!

You are given an array `samples`. Each row corresponds to a voting country, and each column corresponds to a performance that was voted for. The list `country_names` gives the name of each voting country. This dataset was obtained from [Eurovision](http://www.eurovision.tv/page/results).
