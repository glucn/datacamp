### t-SNE visualization of grain dataset

In the video, you saw t-SNE applied to the iris dataset. In this exercise, you'll apply t-SNE to the grain samples data and inspect the resulting t-SNE features using a scatter plot. You are given an array `samples` of grain samples and a list `variety_numbers` giving the variety number of each grain sample.
