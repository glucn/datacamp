### A t-SNE map of the stock market

t-SNE provides great visualizations when the individual samples can be labeled. In this exercise, you'll apply t-SNE to the company stock price data. A scatter plot of the resulting t-SNE features, labeled by the company names, gives you a map of the stock market! The stock price movements for each company are available as the array `normalized_movements` (these have already been normalized for you). The list `companies` gives the name of each company. PyPlot (`plt`) has been imported for you.
