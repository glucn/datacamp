### Hierarchical clustering of the grain data

In the video, you learned that the SciPy `linkage()` function performs hierarchical clustering on an array of samples. Use the `linkage()` function to obtain a hierarchical clustering of the grain samples, and use `dendrogram()` to visualize the result. A sample of the grain measurements is provided in the array `samples`, while the variety of each grain sample is given by the list `varieties`.
