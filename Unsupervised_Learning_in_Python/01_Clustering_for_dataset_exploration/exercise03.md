### How many clusters of grain?

In the video, you learned how to choose a good number of clusters for a dataset using the k-means inertia graph. You are given an array `samples` containing the measurements (such as area, perimeter, length, and several others) of samples of grain. What's a good number of clusters in this case?

`KMeans` and PyPlot (`plt`) have already been imported for you.

This dataset was sourced from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/seeds).
