### Clustering 2D points

From the scatter plot of the previous exercise, you saw that the points seem to separate into 3 clusters. You'll now create a KMeans model to find 3 clusters, and fit it to the data points from the previous exercise. After the model has been fit, you'll obtain the cluster labels for some new points using the `.predict()` method.

You are given the array `points` from the previous exercise, and also an array `new_points`.
