### Scaling fish data for clustering

You are given an array `samples` giving measurements of fish. Each row represents an individual fish. The measurements, such as weight in grams, length in centimeters, and the percentage ratio of height to length, have very different scales. In order to cluster this data effectively, you'll need to standardize these features first. In this exercise, you'll build a pipeline to standardize and cluster the data.

These fish measurement data were sourced from the [Journal of Statistics Education](http://ww2.amstat.org/publications/jse/jse_data_archive.htm).
