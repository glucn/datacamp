### Clustering the fish data

You'll now use your standardization and clustering pipeline from the previous exercise to cluster the fish by their measurements, and then create a cross-tabulation to compare the cluster labels with the fish species.

As before, `samples` is the 2D array of fish measurements. Your pipeline is available as `pipeline`, and the species of every fish sample is given by the list `species`.
