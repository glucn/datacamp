# Spanish NER with polyglot
# You'll continue your exploration of polyglot now with some Spanish annotation. This article is not written by a
# newspaper, so it is your first example of a more blog-like text. How do you think that might compare when finding
# entities?
#
# The Text object has been created as txt, and each entity has been printed, as you can see in the IPython Shell.
#
# Your specific task is to determine how many of the entities contain the words "Márquez" or "Gabo" - these refer to
# the same person in different ways!

from polyglot.text import Text
from preload import article_es
txt = Text(article_es)

# Initialize the count variable: count
count = 0

# Iterate over all the entities
for ent in txt.entities:
    # Check whether the entity contains 'Márquez' or 'Gabo'
    if 'Márquez' in ent or 'Gabo' in ent:
        # Increment count
        count += 1

# Print count
print(count)

# Calculate the percentage of entities that refer to "Gabo": percentage
percentage = count / len(txt.entities)
print(percentage)
