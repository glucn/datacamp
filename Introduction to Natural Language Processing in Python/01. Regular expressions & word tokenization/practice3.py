# More regex with re.search()
# In this exercise, you'll utilize re.search() and re.match() to find specific tokens. Both search and match expect
# regex patterns, similar to those you defined in an earlier exercise. You'll apply these regex library methods to the
# same Monty Python text from the nltk corpora.
#
# You have both scene_one and sentences available from the last exercise; now you can use them with re.search() and
# re.match() to extract and match more text.

import re
from preload import scene_one, sentences

# Search for the first occurrence of "coconuts" in scene_one: match
match = re.search("coconuts", scene_one)

# Print the start and end indexes of match
print(match.start(), match.end())

# Write a regular expression to search for anything in square brackets: pattern1
pattern1 = r"\[.*]"

# Use re.search to find the first text in square brackets
print(re.search(pattern1, scene_one))

# Find the script notation at the beginning of the fourth sentence and print it
pattern2 = r"[\w]+:"
print(re.match(pattern2, sentences[3]))
