# Practicing regular expressions: re.split() and re.findall()
# Now you'll get a chance to write some regular expressions to match digits, strings and non-alphanumeric characters.
# Take a look at my_string first by printing it in the IPython Shell, to determine how you might best match the
# different steps.
#
# Note: It's important to prefix your regex patterns with r to ensure that your patterns are interpreted in the way you
# want them to. Else, you may encounter problems to do with escape sequences in strings. For example, "\n" in Python is
# used to indicate a new line, but if you use the r prefix, it will be interpreted as the raw string "\n" - that is, the
# character "\" followed by the character "n" - and not as a new line.
#
# The regular expression module re has already been imported for you.
#
# Remember from the video that the syntax for the regex library is to always to pass the pattern first, and then the
# string second.
import re
from preload import my_string

# Write a pattern to match sentence endings: sentence_endings
sentence_endings = r"[?!.]"

# Split my_string on sentence endings and print the result
print(re.split(sentence_endings, my_string))

# Find all capitalized words in my_string and print the result
capitalized_words = r"[A-Z]\w+"
print(re.findall(capitalized_words, my_string))

# Split my_string on spaces and print the result
spaces = r"\s+"
print(re.split(spaces, my_string))

# Find all digits in my_string and print the result
digits = r"\d+"
print(re.findall(digits, my_string))
